Note: This project is the first time 3D game-making experience for 6 people working on the project. Therefore, undesirable bugs remained in the game when the project was no longer taken care of.             
Note: Except for the Soundtrack music used in this project, all the remaining assets belong to us. 

The details of the given project assignment are as follows:

Final Project            
Tom is a teenager interested in witchcraft. Because of this, he is ostracized by his family and thrown out. He sees a newspaper while walking on the street. It is written in the newspaper that a volunteer is being sought for an experiment to be carried out in a mental hospital. Tom goes to the hospital and the game starts here. 

Warned by Mike and realizing that the hospital is actually a terrible place, Tom looks for escape routes. Thanks to the Exterminator, Invisibility, and Telekinesis vaccines in the game, Tom gains different powers and uses them to overcome various difficulties and escape from the hospital.
